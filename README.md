## 📌 Objective  
Developed a machine learning–based solution for **INN Hotels Group** (Portugal) to predict hotel booking cancellations, enabling proactive policy design to reduce revenue loss, operational inefficiencies, and last-minute price cuts.

## 🔍 Key Highlights  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyzed **36,275 bookings** across **19 features**, identifying key drivers of cancellations such as **lead time**, **average price per room**, **market segment**, and **number of special requests**.  
- Detected anomalies (e.g., zero-price bookings linked to “Complementary” segment) and corrected unlikely values (e.g., unrealistic children counts).  
- Visualized correlations, booking patterns by month, and customer segments most prone to canceling.  

### **Data Preparation**  
- Encoded categorical variables, handled outliers via **IQR capping**, and used **stratified train-test splits** to preserve class distribution (**32.8% cancellations**).  
- Scaled features for SVM models and engineered derived metrics like **total stay duration**.  

### **Model Development**  
- Implemented and evaluated multiple classifiers:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Support Vector Machine (Linear & RBF kernels)**  
  - **Decision Tree** (with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV)  
  - **Random Forest**  
- Optimized thresholds using **Precision-Recall curves** to balance false positives and false negatives.  
- Reduced overfitting in tree-based models with tuned hyperparameters.

| Decision Tree (Tuned)          | 0.87     | 0.82               | 0.78            | 0.80              |
| **Random Forest** (Best Model) | **0.90** | **0.88**           | **0.80**        | **0.84**          |

## 💡 Business Recommendations  
1. **Incentivize long lead-time bookings** with perks to reduce cancellation risk.  
2. **Adjust pricing strategies** for high-risk segments to improve retention.  
3. **Use special requests as a retention indicator** — customers with more requests cancel less.  
4. Implement **targeted follow-ups** for online bookings, especially during peak months (**Aug–Oct**).
